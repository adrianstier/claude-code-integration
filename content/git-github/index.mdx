## Git Core Concepts

### What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** that tracks changes to your files over time. Think of it as "Track Changes" for code, but much more powerful.

### Key Terms

- **Repository (repo)**: A project tracked by Git
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a point in time
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your project
- **Remote**: A version of your repo hosted elsewhere (like GitHub)
- **Clone**: Download a copy of a remote repo
- **Push**: Send your commits to a remote
- **Pull**: Get commits from a remote

---

## Your First Repository

### Initialize a New Repo

```bash
# Create a project folder
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize Git
git init

# Create a README
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# Check status
git status
```

You'll see README.md is "untracked".

### Make Your First Commit

```bash
# Stage the file
git add README.md

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"

# View history
git log
```

**Best Practice:** Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.

---

## Commit Best Practices

### Good Commit Messages

Use the format:
```
type: brief description

Optional detailed explanation
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

**Examples:**

✅ Good:
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login redirect loop
docs: update installation guide
```

❌ Bad:
```
stuff
fixed
wip
asdf
```

### Using Claude for Commit Messages

Ask Claude:
```
I changed [describe changes]. Write a good commit message.
```

Claude can analyze your `git diff` and suggest a message!

---

## Working with Branches

### Why Branches?

Branches let you work on features without affecting the main code.

### Create and Switch Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature/new-feature

# Switch to it
git checkout feature/new-feature

# OR do both at once
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# List branches
git branch

# See current branch
git branch --show-current
```

### Merge a Branch

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature
git merge feature/new-feature

# Delete the branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

---

## Connecting to GitHub

### Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name: `my-project`
4. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Connect Your Local Repo

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/my-project.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main

# View remotes
git remote -v
```

---

## Daily Git Workflow

### The Basic Cycle

```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git status

# 2. Stage files
git add file1.txt file2.txt
# Or stage everything
git add .

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "feat: add new features"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Pull Before You Push

```bash
# Get latest changes from GitHub
git pull

# Then make your changes and push
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

---

## Working with Claude on Git

### Ask Claude to Plan Commits

```
I made these changes:
[describe changes]

How should I organize these into commits?
```

### Get Help with Conflicts

If you have merge conflicts:

```
I have a merge conflict in [file]. Here's the content:
[paste conflict markers]

Help me resolve it.
```

### Review Before Committing

```
Here's my git diff:
[paste diff]

Review the changes and suggest a commit message.
```

---

## Pull Requests

### What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR) asks to merge your branch into another branch (usually `main`).

### Creating a PR

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Go to your repo on GitHub
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Add title and description:
   ```markdown
   ## What
   [Brief description]

   ## Why
   [Reason for changes]

   ## Changes
   - [Change 1]
   - [Change 2]

   ## Testing
   - [How you tested]
   ```

5. Click "Create pull request"

### Using Claude for PR Descriptions

```
I'm creating a PR for these changes:
[describe changes]

Write a good PR description.
```

---

## Common Git Commands

### Status and Info

```bash
git status              # See what changed
git log                 # View commit history
git log --oneline       # Compact history
git diff                # See unstaged changes
git diff --staged       # See staged changes
git show COMMIT_ID      # View a specific commit
```

### Staging and Committing

```bash
git add FILE            # Stage specific file
git add .               # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message" # Commit with message
git commit --amend      # Fix last commit
```

### Branches

```bash
git branch              # List branches
git branch NAME         # Create branch
git checkout NAME       # Switch branch
git checkout -b NAME    # Create and switch
git merge NAME          # Merge branch
git branch -d NAME      # Delete branch
```

### Remote Operations

```bash
git clone URL           # Clone repository
git remote -v           # List remotes
git push                # Push to remote
git pull                # Pull from remote
git fetch               # Get remote changes (don't merge)
```

### Undo Changes

```bash
git restore FILE        # Discard changes to file
git restore --staged FILE # Unstage file
git reset HEAD~1        # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Undo last commit (delete changes!)
```

---

## Git Ignore

`.gitignore` tells Git which files to ignore.

### Common Patterns

```
# Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
venv/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Environment
.env
.env.local

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.log
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Forgot to Pull Before Committing

```bash
git pull --rebase
# Resolve any conflicts
git push
```

### Want to Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Keep changes, undo commit
git reset HEAD~1

# Delete changes and commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Committed to Wrong Branch

```bash
# Note the commit ID
git log

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout correct-branch

# Cherry-pick the commit
git cherry-pick COMMIT_ID

# Go back and remove from wrong branch
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Pull causes conflicts
git pull

# Fix conflicts in files (look for <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```

---

## Best Practices

### Commit Often

- Small, focused commits are better than large ones
- Commit complete, working changes
- Don't commit broken code

### Write Good Messages

- Clear, concise, descriptive
- Explain why, not just what
- Follow conventional commits

### Use Branches

- `main` should always work
- Create branches for features and fixes
- Delete branches after merging

### Pull Before Push

- Always `git pull` before starting work
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Keeps you in sync with team

### Review Before Committing

```bash
git diff              # See what you changed
git status            # Confirm what you're committing
```

---

## Working with Teams

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:team/project.git
   ```

2. **Create branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-work
   ```

3. **Make changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add feature"
   ```

4. **Push branch**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/my-work
   ```

5. **Create PR** on GitHub

6. **Code review** with team

7. **Merge** PR after approval

8. **Pull main** and repeat:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```
