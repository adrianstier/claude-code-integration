# Git & GitHub Basics

Ever lost hours of work because you forgot to save? Or broke something and couldn't remember what it looked like before? Git fixes both problems—and a lot more.

<Callout type="tip">
Git is the industry standard for version control. Even solo developers use it. Once you learn it, you'll wonder how you ever coded without it.
</Callout>

Unfamiliar with any terms? Our [Glossary](/glossary) has beginner-friendly definitions.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- Track every change to your projects (and undo mistakes)
- Experiment safely with branches
- Push your code to GitHub for backup and collaboration
- Create pull requests for code review
- Use Claude to handle the boring Git stuff

<Diagram title="The Git Mental Model" type="flowchart" caption="Think of Git as checkpoints in a video game">

## Part 1: Understanding Git

### What Problem Does Git Solve?

Without Git, you're one mistake away from disaster. With Git:

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'without', header: 'Without Git' },
    { key: 'with', header: 'With Git' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { without: '"final_v2_REAL_final.docx"', with: 'One file, complete history' },
    { without: "Accidentally delete code, it's gone", with: 'Undo any change, any time' },
    { without: "Can't experiment (might break things)", with: 'Branch, experiment, delete if it fails' },
    { without: '"What changed last week?"', with: 'See exactly who changed what, when' },
    { without: 'Collaborating = emailing files', with: 'Multiple people work on same codebase' },
  ]}
/>

### Key Concepts (Plain English)

`}
</Diagram>

    { key: 'meaning', header: 'What It Actually Means' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { term: <strong>Repository (repo)</strong>, meaning: 'A project folder that Git is tracking' },
    { term: <strong>Commit</strong>, meaning: 'A saved checkpoint of your project' },
    { term: <strong>Branch</strong>, meaning: 'A parallel universe of your code' },
    { term: <strong>Remote</strong>, meaning: 'Your repo on GitHub (in the cloud)' },
    { term: <strong>Push</strong>, meaning: 'Upload your commits to GitHub' },
    { term: <strong>Pull</strong>, meaning: 'Download new commits from GitHub' },
  ]}
/>

## Part 2: Your First Repository

Let's create a repo, make changes, and commit them.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Project">

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Git">

```bash
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` folder that tracks everything.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a File">

```bash
echo "# My Project" > README.md
```

</Step>
<Step title="Check Status">

```bash
git status
```

You'll see README.md listed as "untracked"—Git sees it but isn't tracking it yet.

</Step>
<Step title="Stage the File">

```bash
git add README.md
```

Staging means "I want to include this in my next commit."

</Step>
<Step title="Commit">

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: add README"
```

Congratulations—you've saved your first checkpoint!

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**View your history anytime:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```
</Callout>

## Part 3: The Daily Workflow

This is what you'll do every day:

<Diagram title="Daily Git Cycle" type="flowchart" caption="Rinse and repeat">
{`flowchart LR
    A[Write code] --> B[git status]
    B --> C[git add .]
    C --> D[git commit]
    D --> E[git push]
    E --> A
`}
</Diagram>

### The Commands

```bash
# 1. See what changed
git status

# 2. Stage your changes
git add .                    # Stage everything
# or
git add specific-file.js    # Stage one file

# 3. Commit with a message
git commit -m "feat: add user login"

# 4. Push to GitHub (after you've connected—see Part 5)
git push
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Always run `git status` first.** It shows you exactly what's about to happen. No surprises.
</Callout>

---

## Part 4: Commit Messages That Don't Suck

Your commit messages are a gift to your future self. Make them useful.

### The Format

```
type: brief description

Optional longer explanation
```

### Types

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'type', header: 'Type' },
    { key: 'when', header: 'When to Use' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { type: 'feat', when: 'New feature' },
    { type: 'fix', when: 'Bug fix' },
    { type: 'docs', when: 'Documentation changes' },
    { type: 'refactor', when: 'Code restructuring (no behavior change)' },
    { type: 'test', when: 'Adding or fixing tests' },
    { type: 'chore', when: 'Maintenance (dependencies, configs)' },
  ]}
/>

### Examples

**Good commits:**
```
feat: add password strength indicator
fix: prevent crash when email is empty
docs: add API authentication examples
refactor: extract validation into separate function
```

**Bad commits:**
```
stuff
fixed
wip
asdf
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Let Claude write your commit messages.** After making changes, ask:
```
I changed [describe changes]. Write a commit message.
```
Claude will analyze your `git diff` and write something better than you would.
</Callout>

---

## Part 5: Connecting to GitHub

GitHub is where your code lives in the cloud. It's your backup, your portfolio, and how you collaborate.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a GitHub Repository">

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **+** → **New repository**
3. Name it `my-project`
4. **Don't** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
5. Click **Create repository**

</Step>
<Step title="Connect Your Local Repo">

GitHub shows you the commands. Run them:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/my-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

</Step>
<Step title="Verify">

Refresh your GitHub page. Your code is there!

</Step>
</Steps>

From now on, `git push` sends your commits to GitHub. `git pull` downloads any new commits.

---

## Part 6: Branches — Parallel Universes

Branches let you experiment without affecting your main code. If your experiment works, merge it. If it fails, delete the branch. No harm done.

<Diagram title="Branching Model" type="flowchart" caption="Main stays stable while you experiment">
{`flowchart TB
    A[main] --> B[main]
    B --> C[main]
    B --> D[feature/login]
    D --> E[feature/login]
    E --> F[feature/login]
    F --> G[Merge into main]
    C --> G
    G --> H[main with new feature]
`}
</Diagram>

### Create and Use Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b feature/new-thing

# Make changes, commit as usual
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new thing"

# Push the branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/new-thing
```

### Merge Back to Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge your branch
git merge feature/new-thing

# Delete the branch (optional, but tidy)
git branch -d feature/new-thing

# Push the updated main
git push
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/user-login` — New features
- `fix/login-crash` — Bug fixes
- `docs/api-reference` — Documentation
</Callout>

---

## Part 7: Pull Requests — Code Review

Instead of merging directly, you can create a **pull request (PR)** on GitHub. This lets others review your code before it goes into main.

<Diagram title="Pull Request Flow" type="flowchart" caption="Get feedback before merging">
{`flowchart LR
    A[Create branch] --> B[Make commits]
    B --> C[Push branch]
    C --> D[Open PR on GitHub]
    D --> E[Team reviews]
    E --> F{Approved?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Merge PR]
    F -->|Changes requested| B
`}
</Diagram>

### Creating a PR

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Go to your repo on GitHub
3. Click **Compare & pull request** (GitHub often prompts you)
4. Fill in the template:

```markdown
## What
Brief description of changes

## Why
Why are these changes needed?

## Changes
- Added X
- Fixed Y
- Updated Z

## Testing
How did you test this?
```

5. Click **Create pull request**

<Callout type="tip">
**Let Claude write your PR description:**
```
I'm creating a PR for these changes: [describe]. Write a PR description.
```
</Callout>

## Part 8: Easier Ways to Use Git

**You don't have to memorize commands.** Most developers use visual tools.

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>VS Code</Tab>
    <Tab>GitHub Website</Tab>
    <Tab>GitHub Desktop</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel>
**VS Code Has Git Built-In**

No terminal needed. Click the Source Control icon (branching diagram in sidebar), see all changed files, click + to stage files, type a message, click ✓ to commit, then click ... → Push.

**Install GitLens extension** for superpowers: see who changed each line and when, visual commit history, and compare branches.
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>
**Edit Directly on GitHub**

For quick fixes, you don't need Git at all. Navigate to your file on github.com, click the pencil icon, edit the file, scroll down, add commit message, and click Commit changes.

Perfect for fixing typos, updating documentation, and small changes.
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>
**GitHub Desktop**

Download from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com). Visual interface for all Git operations, drag-and-drop staging, one-click push/pull, and great conflict resolution.

Perfect if you prefer GUI over terminal.
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Part 9: Common Commands Reference

### Everyday Commands

```bash
git status              # What's changed?
git add .               # Stage all changes
git commit -m "msg"     # Commit with message
git push                # Upload to GitHub
git pull                # Download from GitHub
```

### Viewing History

```bash
git log --oneline       # Compact history
git diff                # See unstaged changes
git diff --staged       # See staged changes
git show abc123         # View specific commit
```

### Branches

```bash
git branch              # List branches
git checkout -b name    # Create & switch to branch
git checkout main       # Switch to main
git merge name          # Merge branch into current
git branch -d name      # Delete branch
```

### Undoing Things

```bash
git restore file.txt         # Discard changes to file
git restore --staged file    # Unstage file
git reset HEAD~1             # Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1      # Undo last commit, delete changes
```

<Callout type="warning">
`--hard` deletes your changes. Use carefully!
</Callout>

## Part 10: Troubleshooting

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Merge Conflicts</Tab>
    <Tab>Undo Commit</Tab>
    <Tab>Wrong Branch</Tab>
    <Tab>Push Rejected</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel>

### Merge Conflicts

When two people change the same lines, Git can't decide which version to keep.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your version of the code
=======
Their version of the code
>>>>>>> feature/their-branch
```

**To fix:**
1. Open the file
2. Delete the markers (`<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>`)
3. Keep the code you want
4. Stage and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
   ```

<Callout type="tip">
VS Code has a visual merge conflict resolver. Click "Accept Current", "Accept Incoming", or "Accept Both".
</Callout>

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>

### Undo Last Commit

**Keep the changes, undo the commit:**
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

**Delete everything (careful!):**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Already pushed? Add a new commit that reverts:**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>

### Committed to Wrong Branch

```bash
# Note the commit ID
git log --oneline
# e.g., abc1234

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout correct-branch

# Grab the commit
git cherry-pick abc1234

# Go back and remove from wrong branch
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>

### Push Rejected

Usually means someone else pushed first.

```bash
# Get their changes
git pull --rebase

# Push again
git push
```

If there are conflicts, resolve them first.

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Part 11: .gitignore — What Not to Track

Some files shouldn't be in Git: dependencies, secrets, OS files.

Create `.gitignore` in your project root:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
venv/
__pycache__/

# Secrets
.env
.env.local
*.key

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.log
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Never commit secrets!** If you accidentally commit a password or API key, consider it compromised. Change it immediately.
</Callout>

---

## Part 12: Using Claude for Git

Claude can handle the tedious parts of Git for you.

### Write Commit Messages

```
I made these changes to auth.ts and api.ts.
Analyze my git diff and write a commit message.
```

### Resolve Conflicts

```
I have a merge conflict in this file:
[paste the conflicted file]
Help me resolve it.
```

### Write PR Descriptions

```
I'm creating a PR with these commits:
- abc123: add login form
- def456: add validation
- ghi789: connect to API

Write a PR description.
```

### Explain Errors

```
Git gave me this error:
[paste error]
What does it mean and how do I fix it?
```

---

## Best Practices Summary

<Callout type="tip">
**The golden rules:**

1. **Commit often** — Small, focused commits are better than big ones
2. **Write real messages** — "fix login bug" not "asdf"
3. **Pull before push** — Avoid conflicts
4. **Use branches** — Keep main stable
5. **Review before committing** — Always run `git status` first
</Callout>
