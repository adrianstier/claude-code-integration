# Data Analysis Track

Master data analysis workflows using Python or R with Claude as your coding partner.

<Callout type="tip" title="Choose Your Path">
Pick Python for general-purpose analysis and machine learning, or R for statistical analysis and academic research. Both paths teach the same core concepts.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

- Set up reproducible data projects
- Clean and transform data efficiently
- Create visualizations and models
- Version control your analyses with Git
- Use Claude to write, debug, and explain code

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Start Here](/start-here) setup
- Basic familiarity with either Python or R (or willingness to learn!)

## Choose Your Language

- Handle missing values
- Transform and reshape data
- Use Claude to generate cleaning code

### 3. Exploratory Analysis
- Summary statistics
- Grouping and aggregation
- Data visualization basics
- Interactive exploration with Claude

### 4. Modeling & Insights
- Build predictive models
- Evaluate model performance
- Create compelling visualizations
- Document findings

### 5. Reproducible Output
