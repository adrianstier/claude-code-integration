# Data Analysis Track

You've got messy data. Maybe it's a CSV export from your CRM that looks like it was formatted by someone who hates you. Or survey results with inconsistent responses. Or sales numbers spread across 47 Excel files.

By the end of this track, you'll turn that chaos into insights—and actually understand what you're doing along the way.

<Diagram title="The Data Analysis Journey" type="flowchart" caption="From mess to insights">
{`flowchart LR
    A[📁 Raw Data] --> B[🧹 Clean]
    B --> C[🔍 Explore]
    C --> D[📊 Visualize]
    D --> E[🧠 Model]
    E --> F[📝 Report]
`}
</Diagram>

## What Makes This Different

This isn't "learn pandas methods" or "memorize ggplot syntax." You'll work on **real data problems** with Claude as your coding partner.

<Callout type="tip">
**Claude writes the code. You understand the data.** That's the workflow. You describe what you need, Claude generates it, and you learn by doing.
</Callout>

## Python vs R: Pick Your Tool

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Python</Tab>
    <Tab>R</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel>
**Python** is the Swiss Army knife of data analysis.

Best for: Machine learning, web scraping, automation, production systems, general-purpose programming.

You'll use: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks.

**Who chooses Python:**
- Data scientists in tech companies
- Anyone doing machine learning
- People who want one language for everything
- Developers who also need to build apps

  <TabPanel>
**R** was built by statisticians, for statisticians.

Best for: Statistical analysis, data visualization, academic research, reporting.

You'll use: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, RMarkdown.

**Who chooses R:**
- Researchers and academics
- Anyone doing serious statistical analysis
- Data journalists
- People who love beautiful visualizations

<Callout type="note">
**Can't decide?** Start with Python. It's more versatile, and the skills transfer to R easily. You can always learn R later for specialized statistical work.

## What You'll Learn

{`flowchart TB
    subgraph foundation["Foundation"]
        A[Project Setup]
        B[Data Import]
    end

    subgraph core["Core Skills"]
        C[Data Cleaning]
        D[Transformation]
        E[Visualization]
    end

    subgraph advanced["Advanced"]
        F[Modeling]

    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
`}
</Diagram>

### By the End, You'll Be Able To:

1. **Set up reproducible projects** — No more "it worked on my machine"
2. **Clean messy data** — Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicates
3. **Transform data** — Reshape, aggregate, join datasets
4. **Create visualizations** — Charts that actually communicate insights
5. **Build models** — Regression, classification, clustering basics
6. **Generate reports** — Share findings with stakeholders

## The Workflow (Both Tracks)

Every data project follows the same pattern:

<Diagram title="Analysis Workflow" type="flowchart" caption="This cycle repeats constantly">
{`flowchart TB
    A[1. Ask a question] --> B[2. Get the data]
    B --> C[3. Clean it]
    C --> D[4. Explore]
    D --> E{Found insight?}
    E -->|No| A
    E -->|Yes| F[5. Visualize]
    F --> G[6. Document]
    G --> H[7. Share]
`}
</Diagram>

### How Claude Fits In

At each step, Claude helps you:

| Step | What Claude Does |
|------|------------------|
| **Get data** | Write import code, handle file formats |
| **Clean** | Generate cleaning code, explain why |
| **Explore** | Suggest analyses, write aggregations |
| **Visualize** | Create charts, customize styling |
| **Model** | Build models, explain results |
| **Document** | Write reports, explain findings |

## Sample Projects

These are the kinds of problems you'll solve:

### Python Track Examples
- **Sales Analysis**: Clean 12 months of messy exports, find seasonal patterns
- **Customer Segmentation**: Cluster customers by behavior, identify high-value groups
- **Churn Prediction**: Build a model to predict which users will leave

### R Track Examples
- **Survey Analysis**: Clean Likert-scale data, run statistical tests
- **Time Series**: Forecast next quarter's revenue
- **Research Report**: Publication-ready figures and tables

## Time Commitment

| Track | Duration | Prerequisites |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Python | 4-6 hours | [Start Here](/start-here) complete |
| R | 4-6 hours | [Start Here](/start-here) complete |

<Callout type="tip">
**Work in chunks.** Each section is 30-60 minutes. You don't need to finish in one sitting.
</Callout>

## What You'll Build

By the end, you'll have:

- A **complete analysis project** you can show employers
- **Reusable scripts** for common tasks (cleaning, plotting, etc.)
- **Git history** showing your analytical process
- **Confidence** to tackle new data problems
