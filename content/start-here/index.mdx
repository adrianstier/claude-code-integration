# Start Here

You're about to set up the most powerful coding environment available. In about an hour, you'll have an AI that can read your entire codebase, write code alongside you, run commands, and help you ship real projects.

<Callout type="tip">
Already have VS Code and Git? Skip to [Quick Start Exercise](/start-here/quick-start-exercise) to jump straight into Claude Code.
</Callout>

## What You're Building

By the end of this track, you'll have:

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>VS Code installed and configured</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Claude Code extension working</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Git configured with your identity</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>GitHub account connected via SSH</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Your first repo cloned with Claude templates</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

    A[VS Code] --> B[Git]
    B --> C[GitHub]
    C --> D[Claude Code]
    D --> E[🚀 Ready to Build]
`}
</Diagram>

**Here's what each piece does:**

| Tool | What It Does | Why You Need It |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **VS Code** | Your code editor | Where you write and read code |
| **Git** | Version control | Never lose work, undo mistakes |
| **GitHub** | Cloud backup + collaboration | Share code, work with others |
| **Claude Code** | AI coding partner | Understands your whole project |

## What Makes Claude Code Different?

Most AI coding tools work like a chatbot—you copy code in, get an answer, paste it back. That's tedious and error-prone.

Claude Code works differently:

<Diagram title="Claude Code vs Traditional AI" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart TB
    subgraph traditional["Traditional AI Chatbots"]
        A1[Copy code] --> A2[Paste into chat]
        A2 --> A3[Get response]
        A3 --> A4[Copy back]
        A4 --> A5[Hope it works]
    end

    subgraph claude["Claude Code"]
        B1[Ask Claude] --> B2[Claude reads your files]
        B2 --> B3[Claude writes changes directly]
        B3 --> B4[You review & approve]
    end
`}
</Diagram>

**With Claude Code, you can:**

- Ask questions about code you don't understand
- Get changes applied directly to your files
- Run terminal commands without memorizing syntax
- Debug errors by just pasting them
- Generate entire features with context of your whole project

<Callout type="note">
Claude Code runs locally in VS Code but connects to Anthropic's API. Your code stays on your machine—only what you send to Claude goes to the cloud.
</Callout>

## After Setup: Where to Go Next

Once you've finished setup, pick the track that matches your goals:

| Track | Best For | You'll Build |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| [Data Analysis](/data-analysis) | Researchers, analysts | Data pipelines, visualizations, reports |
| [App Builder](/app-builder) | Developers, entrepreneurs | Web apps, APIs, dashboards |
| [Automation](/automation) | Anyone doing repetitive tasks | Scripts, workflows, bots |
| [Git & GitHub](/git-github) | Everyone | Version control fundamentals |

<Callout type="tip">
**New to coding?** Start with [Git & GitHub](/git-github) after setup. Understanding version control early saves headaches later.
</Callout>
