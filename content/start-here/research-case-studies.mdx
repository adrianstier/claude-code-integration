# Research Case Studies

See Claude Code in action with complete academic workflows. These aren't toy examples—they're the kinds of tasks that eat up your research time.

## Case Study 1: From Raw Data to Publication Figure

**Scenario:** You have messy field data and need a publication-ready figure for a journal submission deadline.

### The Problem

```
Raw data: 847 observations across 12 sites
Issues: Mixed date formats, missing values coded differently, outliers
Deadline: Journal submission due in 3 days
```

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Assess the mess**

```bash
claude "Read data/field_observations.csv and give me a data quality report:
- Missing values by column
- Date format inconsistencies
- Potential outliers
- Any obvious data entry errors"
```

Claude examines your data and returns:

```
Data Quality Report for field_observations.csv:

MISSING VALUES:
- temperature: 23 missing (2.7%)
- salinity: 8 missing (0.9%)
- depth: 0 missing
- species_count: 45 missing (5.3%) ← mostly from Site_07

DATE ISSUES:
- Rows 1-234: MM/DD/YYYY format
- Rows 235-847: YYYY-MM-DD format
- 3 rows have "unknown" as date

OUTLIERS (>3 SD):
- temperature: 2 values (89°C, 91°C) ← likely Fahrenheit not Celsius
- species_count: 1 value (9,847) ← likely typo, check field notes

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Convert temperature outliers: (F-32)*5/9
2. Investigate Site_07 missing species counts
3. Standardize dates to ISO format
```

**Step 2: Clean with audit trail**

```bash
claude "Create a cleaning script that:
1. Fixes the issues you identified
2. Logs every change made (row, column, old value, new value)
3. Saves cleaned data with '_cleaned' suffix
4. Generates a cleaning report I can include in supplementary materials

Use pandas. Make it reproducible."
```

**Step 3: Generate the figure**

```bash
claude "Create a publication-ready figure showing:
- Species count by site (x-axis) vs temperature (y-axis)
- Color by depth category (shallow/medium/deep)
- Include regression line with 95% CI
- Error bars showing standard error

Style requirements:
- 300 DPI for print
- Sans-serif fonts (Nature style)
- Colorblind-friendly palette
- Panel dimensions: 180mm x 120mm

Save as both PNG and PDF."
```

### Time Comparison

| Task | Traditional | With Claude Code |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Data quality assessment | 45 min | 3 min |
| Cleaning script | 2-3 hours | 15 min |
| Publication figure | 1-2 hours | 10 min |
| **Total** | **4-5 hours** | **~30 min** |

## Case Study 2: Inheriting a Grad Student's Code

**Scenario:** Your grad student defended and left. Now you need to re-run their analysis for a follow-up paper. The code "worked on their laptop."

### The Problem

- Code references absolute paths (`/Users/alex/Desktop/thesis/...`)
- Missing dependency versions ("it just needs pandas")
- Cryptic error: `KeyError: 'treatment_group'`
- No documentation

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Forensic analysis**

```bash
claude "Analyze the code in legacy_analysis/:
1. List all Python files and their apparent purpose
2. Identify all dependencies being imported
3. Find all hardcoded paths that need updating
4. Identify where 'treatment_group' should come from
5. Create a dependency list with likely version requirements

Be thorough—I need to get this running without the original author."
```

**Step 2: Create reproducible environment**

```bash
claude "Based on your analysis:
1. Create a requirements.txt with pinned versions
2. Create a setup script that:
   - Sets up a virtual environment
   - Installs dependencies
   - Creates necessary directories
3. Update all hardcoded paths to use relative paths or config file
4. Add the missing 'treatment_group' column based on the data patterns you see"
```

**Step 3: Document for posterity**

```bash
claude "Create documentation for this project:
1. README.md explaining what the analysis does
2. Add docstrings to all functions
3. Create a flowchart of the analysis pipeline
4. Add inline comments for non-obvious code

This needs to be understandable by the next grad student."
```

## Case Study 3: Multi-Author Analysis Integration

**Scenario:** Three co-authors analyzed different aspects of the same dataset. One used R, one used Python, one used Stata. You need to integrate their results.

### The Problem

```
Author 1 (R/tidyverse): Descriptive statistics, demographic analysis
Author 2 (Python/statsmodels): Main regression models
Author 3 (Stata): Robustness checks, instrumental variables

All analyzing: survey_data_2024.csv
Output formats: .rds, .pkl, .dta
```

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Standardize outputs**

```bash
claude "I have analysis outputs in three formats:
- author1_results/ contains .rds files (R)
- author2_results/ contains .pkl files (Python)
- author3_results/ contains .dta files (Stata)

Create a script that:
1. Reads all result files
2. Extracts key statistics (coefficients, SEs, p-values, CIs)
3. Standardizes to a common format
4. Outputs a combined results table

Handle the different statistical object structures appropriately."
```

**Step 2: Create master results table**

```bash
claude "Using the standardized results, create:
1. A master regression table (Table 2 format) combining all models
2. Export as:
   - LaTeX (for manuscript)
   - Word-compatible format (for co-authors who don't use LaTeX)
   - CSV (for supplementary materials)

Use APA formatting for statistics."
```

**Step 3: Verify consistency**

```bash
claude "Cross-check the three analyses:
1. Do sample sizes match where they should?
2. Are baseline descriptives consistent?
3. Flag any discrepancies between authors' results
4. Create a verification report I can share with co-authors"
```

## Case Study 4: BCO-DMO Data Documentation

**Scenario:** NSF requires you to submit your data to BCO-DMO. You need comprehensive metadata documentation.

### The Workflow

```bash
claude "I need to prepare my dataset for BCO-DMO submission.

Read data/coral_survey_2024.csv and create:

1. A data dictionary with:
   - Variable names
   - Data types
   - Units
   - Allowed values/ranges
   - Missing value codes
   - Collection methods (I'll fill these in)

2. Methods documentation covering:
   - Sampling design
   - Data collection protocols
   - Quality control procedures
   - Known limitations

3. A README following BCO-DMO guidelines

Format everything in their required template structure."
```

## Quick Reference: Research Prompts That Work

### Data Cleaning
```
"Read [file] and identify data quality issues. For each issue, suggest a fix and explain the tradeoff."
```

### Statistical Analysis
```
"Run [specific test] on [variables] and interpret the results as I would for a Methods section. Include effect sizes."
```

### Visualization
```
"Create a [plot type] suitable for [journal]. Use [specific style guide] formatting. Make it colorblind-accessible."
```

### Code Documentation
```
"Add documentation to [file] that would let a new grad student understand and modify it. Include example usage."
```

## What These Cases Have in Common

1. **Real deadlines** — Not "exploring data for fun" but "paper submission due Friday"
2. **Messy inputs** — Data and code are never as clean as tutorials assume
3. **Audit trails** — Academic work requires documentation of every decision
4. **Multiple formats** — Journals want LaTeX, co-authors want Word, repos want Markdown
5. **Reproducibility** — Someone else needs to run this code in 5 years
