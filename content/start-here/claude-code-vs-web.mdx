# Claude Code vs Claude Web Interface

Understanding when to use Claude Code (the CLI tool) versus the Claude.com web interface will help you work more effectively. Each has unique strengths for different tasks.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Simple Rule">
Use Claude Code for **doing** (writing code, running tests, git operations) and Claude Web for **thinking** (brainstorming, learning, planning).
</Callout>

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code (CLI) | Claude.com (Web) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **File Access** | Direct read/write to your files | Copy/paste only |
| **Code Execution** | Run bash commands, tests, builds | No execution capability |
| **Git Integration** | Full git operations (commit, push, PR) | No git access |
| **Context** | Sees your entire codebase | Limited to conversation |
| **Persistence** | CLAUDE.md files for project memory | Conversation history only |
| **Tool Use** | MCP servers, custom tools | Web search, artifacts |
| **Best For** | Development tasks | Brainstorming, learning |

## When to Use Claude Code

### Development Tasks
Claude Code excels when you need to:

- **Write and modify code** - Direct file editing without copy/paste
- **Run tests and builds** - Execute `npm test`, `pytest`, etc.
- **Debug issues** - Read error logs, check file states
- **Git operations** - Commit, create branches, open PRs
- **Refactor codebases** - Multi-file changes with context

```bash
# Example: Claude Code can do this in one request
claude "Add error handling to all API routes, run the tests,
       and commit the changes with a descriptive message"
```

### Project-Specific Knowledge
With CLAUDE.md files, Claude Code remembers:
- Your coding standards
- Project architecture
- Common commands
- File conventions

### Multi-Step Workflows
Claude Code handles complex workflows:

```bash
# Claude Code can execute this entire workflow
claude "Create a new React component for user profiles,
       add tests, update the exports, and run the build"
```

## When to Use Claude Web

### Brainstorming & Planning
The web interface is better for:

- **Architecture discussions** - Think through designs before coding
- **Learning concepts** - Understand new technologies
- **Code review** - Paste code for detailed review
- **Writing documentation** - Draft READMEs, guides

### Quick Questions
For isolated questions that don't need file access:

- "How do I implement rate limiting in Express?"
- "What's the difference between useMemo and useCallback?"
- "Explain this error message..."

### Visual Artifacts
Claude.com can create:
- Interactive diagrams
- Preview components
- Downloadable files

## Permission-Based Workflow

One of Claude Code's unique features is its **permission system**. Unlike the web interface, Claude Code asks before taking actions that affect your system.

### How Permissions Work

When Claude Code wants to:
- Read a file → Asks permission first
- Write/edit a file → Asks permission first
- Run a bash command → Asks permission first

```
Claude wants to edit src/utils/api.ts
Allow? [y/n/always]
```

### Permission Options

- **y** - Allow this specific action once
- **n** - Deny this action
- **always** - Allow this type of action for the session

### Configuring Permissions

You can pre-approve certain actions in your settings:

```bash
# Allow all read operations
claude config set allowedTools.Read always

# Allow specific bash commands
claude config set allowedTools.Bash "npm test, npm run build"
```

### Safe Experimentation Mode

For trusted projects, you can enable broader permissions:

```bash
# Enable "YOLO mode" for the session (use carefully!)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Warning**: Only use this in isolated environments or for trusted projects.

## Optimizing Your Prompts

Claude Code responds to prompts differently than the web interface because it has access to your files and tools.

### Be Specific About Actions

**Web Interface Style** (too vague for Claude Code):
```
"Help me fix the authentication bug"
```

**Claude Code Style** (actionable):
```
"Read src/auth/login.ts, find why the JWT token isn't being
refreshed, fix the issue, and run the auth tests"
```

### Include File Paths When Known

```bash
# Good - specific path
claude "Update the API endpoint in src/services/api.ts to use v2"

# Less good - requires searching
claude "Update the API endpoint to use v2"
```

### Request Verification

```bash
# Ask Claude Code to verify its changes
claude "Add input validation to the signup form,
       then run the tests to verify it works"
```

### Use CLAUDE.md for Repeated Instructions

Instead of repeating context in every prompt, add it to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Important Rules
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Write tests before implementing features
- Use Zod for runtime validation
```

Then your prompts can be simpler:
```bash
claude "Add a new endpoint for user preferences"
# Claude Code will automatically follow your CLAUDE.md rules
```

### Multi-Step Task Prompts

Claude Code handles complex workflows well:

```bash
claude "I need to:
1. Add a dark mode toggle component
2. Create a theme context provider
3. Update the layout to use the provider
4. Add the toggle to the navbar
5. Test the implementation"
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix (Claude Code)

```bash
claude "There's a bug where users can't upload images larger
       than 1MB. Check the upload handler in src/api/uploads,
       increase the limit to 10MB, add proper error messages,
       and test with a large file"
```

Claude Code will:
1. Read the upload handler file
2. Find the size limit configuration
3. Update the code
4. Add error handling
5. Run tests or suggest manual testing

### Example 2: Learning (Claude Web)

In Claude.com:
```
"Explain how React Server Components work.
What are the benefits over traditional client components?
When should I use each?"
```

Best for learning because:
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Follow-up questions easy to ask
- Can create visual diagrams
- No project files needed

### Example 3: Code Review (Either)

**Claude Code** (if code is in your project):
```bash
claude "Review src/components/Dashboard.tsx for
       performance issues and accessibility"
```

**Claude Web** (for isolated review):
```
"Review this React component for performance issues:
[paste code]"
```

## Workflow Integration

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Plan in Claude Web**
   - Discuss architecture
   - Explore approaches
   - Learn new concepts

2. **Implement with Claude Code**
   - Write code with file access
   - Run tests and builds
   - Commit changes

3. **Review in Either**
   - Code review
   - Documentation
   - Final polish

### Example Integrated Workflow

**Step 1: Claude Web**
```
"I want to add user authentication to my Next.js app.
What are my options? Compare NextAuth vs Clerk vs Auth0."
```

**Step 2: Claude Code**
```bash
claude "Set up NextAuth with GitHub and Google providers.
       Create the auth API route, add the session provider
       to the layout, and create a protected dashboard page"
```

**Step 3: Claude Web**
```
"Review my authentication implementation for security best practices:
[paste key files]"
```

## Summary

| Task Type | Best Tool | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Writing code | Claude Code | Direct file access |
| Running commands | Claude Code | Bash execution |
| Git operations | Claude Code | Full git integration |
| Learning concepts | Claude Web | Detailed explanations |
| Brainstorming | Claude Web | No context constraints |
| Code review | Either | Depends on file access needs |
| Documentation | Either | Web for drafts, Code for files |

The key insight: **Claude Code is for doing, Claude Web is for thinking**. Use both together for maximum productivity.
