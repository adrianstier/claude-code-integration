## How to Use These Guides

Start with the [Setup Guide](/start-here) for your operating system. Each tutorial builds on the previous one, so following them in order works best.

The guides include code you can copy and run. If something doesn't work, check the troubleshooting sections or the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).
