# Welcome to Claude Code Learning Hub

We're excited to launch Claude Code Learning Hub, a free and open-source learning platform designed to help developers, researchers, and beginners master AI-powered development.

## What You'll Find Here

Our platform offers comprehensive learning tracks covering:

- **Getting Started** - Complete setup guides for Mac and Windows

3. Includes hands-on projects you can add to your portfolio
4. Works for both Mac and Windows users
5. Is completely free and open source
