## Project 1: Task Manager with Next.js

Your first real app. A beautiful task manager that persists data and works on any device.

<Diagram title="Task Manager Architecture" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart TB
    subgraph ui[User Interface]
        A[TaskForm] --> B[TaskList]
        B --> C[TaskItem]
        D[FilterBar] --> B
    end

    subgraph state[State Management]
        E[useTasks Hook]
        F[localStorage]
    end

    B --> E
    E --> F
`}
</Diagram>

### What You'll Build

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Organize with categories and due dates
- Mark tasks as complete with satisfying animations
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Fully responsive—works on phone, tablet, desktop

### Step 1: Project Setup

Tell Claude what you want:

```
Create a new Next.js 14 app for a task manager with:
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router
- ESLint

Set up the project structure with components/, lib/, and hooks/ folders.
```

<FileTree>
  <FolderNode name="task-manager" defaultOpen>
    <FolderNode name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FolderNode name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileNode name="layout.tsx" />
        <FileNode name="page.tsx" />
      </FolderNode>
      <FolderNode name="components" defaultOpen>
        <FileNode name="TaskList.tsx" />
        <FileNode name="TaskItem.tsx" />
        <FileNode name="TaskForm.tsx" />
        <FileNode name="FilterBar.tsx" />
      </FolderNode>
      <FolderNode name="lib">
        <FileNode name="types.ts" />
      </FolderNode>
      <FolderNode name="hooks">
        <FileNode name="useTasks.ts" />
      </FolderNode>
    </FolderNode>
    <FileNode name="tailwind.config.js" />
    <FileNode name="package.json" />
  </FolderNode>
</FileTree>

### Step 2: Define Your Data

```
Define TypeScript types for a task manager:
- Task interface with id, title, description, status, category, dueDate
- Status type (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Category type

Put these in src/lib/types.ts
```

### Step 3: Build Components

Work through each component:

```
Create a TaskForm component that:
1. Has inputs for title, description, category, due date
2. Validates inputs before submission
3. Uses Tailwind for a clean, modern look
4. Works for both creating and editing tasks
5. Has accessible labels and proper focus management
```

Then the list:

```
Build a TaskList component that:
1. Displays tasks in a responsive grid
2. Shows status with color-coded badges
3. Has smooth hover effects
4. Includes delete and edit buttons
5. Groups tasks by status or category
```

### Step 4: State Management

The heart of your app:

```
Create a custom hook useTasks that:
1. Manages task state (add, edit, delete, toggle status)
2. Persists to localStorage automatically
3. Loads saved tasks on page load
4. Provides filtering and sorting
5. Uses TypeScript for type safety
```

### Step 5: Polish It

Make it feel professional:

```
Add finishing touches:
1. Smooth animations for adding/removing tasks
2. Dark mode that respects system preference
3. Loading skeleton while hydrating from localStorage
4. Empty state with helpful message
5. Confetti animation when completing all tasks
```

### Step 6: Deploy

Ship it to the world:

```
Help me deploy to Vercel:
1. Create a git repository
2. Push the code
3. Connect to Vercel
4. Deploy and get a live URL
```

<Callout type="success" title="Checkpoint">
Test your app: Create 5 tasks, edit one, complete two, delete one, refresh the page. Everything should persist.
</Callout>

## Project 2: Weather Dashboard

Now let's work with external data. You'll build a beautiful weather app that fetches real-time data from an API.

<Diagram title="Weather Dashboard Flow" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart LR
    A[User Input] --> B[API Call]
    B --> C[Weather Service]
    C --> D[Parse Response]
    D --> E[Update UI]
    E --> F[Charts & Cards]
`}
</Diagram>

### What You'll Build

- Search weather for any city worldwide
- See current conditions with beautiful icons
- 5-day forecast with temperature charts
- Save favorite cities
- Dynamic backgrounds that match the weather

### Step 1: Setup and API Key

```
Create a React + Vite project for a weather dashboard.
I'll use the OpenWeatherMap API (it's free).

1. Set up the project with TypeScript
2. Install axios for API calls and recharts for graphs
3. Show me how to get a free API key
4. Configure environment variables securely
```

### Step 2: Build the API Layer

```
Create a weather service that:
1. Fetches current weather by city name
2. Gets 5-day/3-hour forecast data
3. Handles errors gracefully (city not found, rate limits)
4. Uses TypeScript types for API responses
5. Includes retry logic for failed requests
```

### Step 3: Create the UI

```
Build these components with Tailwind:

1. SearchBar - City search with autocomplete feel
2. CurrentWeather - Big temperature, condition icon, city name
3. ForecastCard - Single day with high/low
4. ForecastList - 5-day horizontal scroll
5. WeatherDetails - Wind, humidity, pressure, UV index

Use a glassmorphism design with backdrop blur.
```

### Step 4: Add Data Visualization

```
Create a temperature chart with Recharts:
1. Show hourly temps for next 24 hours
2. Use a gradient area chart
3. Make it responsive
4. Match the color scheme to weather condition
5. Add tooltips on hover
```

### Step 5: Dynamic Theming

```
Make the UI respond to weather:
1. Sunny = warm gradient background
2. Cloudy = gray, muted tones
3. Rainy = blue-gray with rain animation
4. Night = dark theme with stars
5. Smooth CSS transitions between states
```

### Step 6: Save Favorites

```
Let users save favorite cities:
1. Add to favorites button
2. Store in localStorage
3. Show favorites as quick-access cards
4. Sync across browser tabs
5. Remove from favorites option
```

`}
</Diagram>

### What You'll Build

- RESTful API for product inventory
- JWT authentication
- Auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Database with SQLAlchemy
- Input validation with Pydantic
- Comprehensive tests

### Step 1: Project Setup

```
Create a FastAPI project for a product inventory API:
1. Set up virtual environment
2. Install FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
3. Create proper folder structure
4. Add a health check endpoint
5. Configure hot reload for development
```

### Step 2: Database Layer

```
Create SQLAlchemy models:
- Product (id, name, description, price, quantity, category_id)
- Category (id, name, description)
- User (id, email, hashed_password, is_active, is_admin)

Set up SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-ready for production.
```

### Step 3: Pydantic Schemas

```
Create Pydantic models for:
- ProductCreate, ProductUpdate, ProductResponse
- UserCreate, UserLogin, UserResponse
- CategoryCreate, CategoryResponse

Add validation:
- Price must be positive
- Email must be valid format
- Password minimum 8 characters
```

### Step 4: CRUD Endpoints

```
Implement REST endpoints:
- POST /products - Create product
- GET /products - List with pagination, filtering, sorting
- GET /products/{id} - Get single product
- PUT /products/{id} - Update product
- DELETE /products/{id} - Delete product

Use proper HTTP status codes and error responses.
```

### Step 5: Authentication

```
Add JWT authentication:
1. POST /auth/register - Create user account
2. POST /auth/login - Returns access + refresh tokens
3. POST /auth/refresh - Get new access token
4. Password hashing with bcrypt
5. Protected routes require valid JWT
6. Role-based permissions (user vs admin)
```

### Step 6: Testing
