### Features

-  Create, edit, and delete tasks
-  Organize with categories
- ⏰ Set due dates
-  Mark tasks as complete
- 💾 Persist data in local storage
- 📱 Fully responsive design

### Step 1: Project Setup

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create a new Next.js 14 app for a task manager with:
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router
- ESLint

Set up the project structure with best practices.
```

Expected structure:
```
task-manager/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── TaskList.tsx
│   │   ├── TaskItem.tsx
│   │   ├── TaskForm.tsx
│   │   └── FilterBar.tsx
│   ├── lib/
│   │   └── types.ts
│   └── hooks/
│       └── useTasks.ts
├── public/
├── tailwind.config.js
└── package.json
```

### Step 2: Define Data Types

Create `/src/lib/types.ts`:

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Define TypeScript types for a task manager:
- Task interface with id, title, description, status, category, dueDate
- Status type (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Category type
```

### Step 3: Build the Task Form Component

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create a TaskForm component that:
1. Has inputs for title, description, category, due date
2. Validates inputs
3. Uses Tailwind for styling with a modern look
4. Emits onSubmit event with task data
5. Can be used for both creating and editing tasks
```

### Step 4: Create the Task List

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Build a TaskList component that:
1. Displays tasks in a grid/list view
2. Shows task status with color coding
3. Has hover effects and animations
4. Includes delete and edit buttons
5. Groups tasks by status
```

### Step 5: Add State Management

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create a custom hook useTasks that:
1. Manages task state (add, edit, delete, toggle)
2. Persists to localStorage
3. Loads from localStorage on mount
4. Provides filter/sort functionality
```

### Step 6: Build the Main Page

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create the main page that:
1. Uses the useTasks hook
2. Displays TaskForm and TaskList
3. Implements filtering (All, Active, Completed)
4. Shows task statistics (total, completed, pending)
5. Has a clean, modern layout with Tailwind
```

### Step 7: Add Styling and Polish

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Enhance the app with:
1. Smooth animations for add/remove/complete
2. Dark mode support
3. Loading states
4. Empty states with helpful messages
5. Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
```

### Step 8: Deploy

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Help me deploy my Next.js task manager to Vercel:
1. Set up Vercel account
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings
4. Deploy and test
```

### Testing Your App

Test these scenarios:
1.  Create multiple tasks
2.  Edit existing tasks
3.  Mark tasks as complete
4.  Delete tasks
5.  Refresh page (data persists)
6.  Filter by status
7.  Test on mobile device

3. Handles errors gracefully
4. Uses TypeScript types for API responses
5. Includes loading states
```

### Step 3: Build Weather Display Components

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create components for:
1. CurrentWeather - Shows temp, condition, icon, city name
2. ForecastCard - Displays single day forecast
3. ForecastList - Shows 5-day forecast
4. WeatherDetails - Wind, humidity, pressure, etc.

Use Tailwind CSS with a modern, glassmorphism design.
```

### Step 4: Add Data Visualization

**Ask Claude Code:**
```

2. Uses a gradient line chart
3. Has responsive sizing
4. Matches the app's color scheme
```

### Step 5: Implement Dynamic Backgrounds

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create dynamic backgrounds that change based on:

2. Time of day (day/night)
3. Use CSS gradients and animations
4. Smooth transitions between states
```

### Step 6: Add Multiple Cities

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Implement:
1. Save favorite cities to localStorage
2. Display multiple city cards
3. Quick switch between cities
4. Remove cities from favorites
```

### Step 7: Polish and Deploy

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Add finishing touches:
1. Loading skeletons
2. Error messages with retry
