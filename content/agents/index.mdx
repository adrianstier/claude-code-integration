# AI Agents Track

Build intelligent agents that can reason, plan, and take actions autonomously! This track teaches you everything from understanding what agents are to building production-ready agent systems.

<Callout type="info" title="What Makes This Track Different">
Agents are not just chatbots. They can work independently, use tools, and accomplish complex multi-step tasks. This track teaches you to harness this powerful capability.
</Callout>

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that can:

- **Perceive**: Understand context and gather information
- **Reason**: Think through problems step-by-step
- **Plan**: Break down complex tasks into actionable steps
- **Act**: Execute actions using tools and APIs

## Sub-Agents: Specialized Delegation

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that can be orchestrated by the main agent. They enable powerful context management and parallelization patterns.

### Why Use Sub-Agents?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context Isolation** | Sub-agents maintain separate context, preventing information overload |
| **Parallelization** | Multiple sub-agents can run concurrently for faster workflows |
| **Specialized Knowledge** | Each sub-agent has tailored prompts and expertise |
| **Tool Restrictions** | Limit sub-agents to specific tools for safety |

### Built-in Sub-Agents

Claude Code includes specialized built-in sub-agents:

- **Plan Sub-Agent** - Dedicated planning with task breakdown
- **Explore Sub-Agent** - Fast, read-only codebase search and analysis

### Creating Custom Sub-Agents

Define sub-agents as markdown files in `.claude/agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Use for quality, security, and maintainability reviews.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are a code review specialist with expertise in security, performance, and best practices.

When reviewing code:
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Check for performance issues
- Verify adherence to coding standards
- Suggest specific improvements
```

### Programmatic Sub-Agents (SDK)

When using the Claude Agent SDK, define sub-agents in code:

```typescript
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

const result = query({
  prompt: "Review the authentication module",
  options: {
    agents: {
      'code-reviewer': {
        description: 'Expert code review specialist',
        prompt: 'You are a security-focused code reviewer...',
        tools: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob'],
        model: 'sonnet'
      },
      'test-runner': {
        description: 'Runs and analyzes test suites',
        prompt: 'You are a test execution specialist...',
        tools: ['Bash', 'Read', 'Grep']
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Common Tool Combinations

| Agent Type | Tools | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Read-only | `Read, Grep, Glob` | Analysis, review |
| Test runner | `Bash, Read, Grep` | Test execution |
| Code modifier | `Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob` | Refactoring |

For detailed sub-agent documentation, see the [official Sub-Agents guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/subagents).

## The Agent Loop

At its core, every agent follows this pattern:

```
1. OBSERVE   - Gather context and information
2. THINK     - Reason about what to do next
3. PLAN      - Break task into steps
4. ACT       - Execute using tools
5. REFLECT   - Evaluate results
6. REPEAT    - Continue until goal achieved
```

### Example: Research Agent

```python
# Pseudocode for a research agent

while not research_complete:
    # OBSERVE
    query = understand_user_question()

    # THINK
    information_needed = identify_knowledge_gaps()

    # PLAN
    search_queries = generate_search_plan()

    # ACT
    for query in search_queries:
        results = web_search(query)
        notes = extract_key_information(results)

    # REFLECT
    if sufficient_information():
        research_complete = True
        synthesize_findings()
    else:
        refine_search_strategy()
```

## Tools: The Agent's Hands

Tools give agents the ability to interact with the world:

### Common Tool Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Information** | Web search, document reading, API calls |
| **Computation** | Code execution, calculations, data analysis |
| **Creation** | Writing files, generating images, sending messages |
| **Control** | System commands, application control, device actions |

### Tool Design Principles

1. **Clear purpose**: Each tool does one thing well
2. **Defined inputs**: Specific parameters with types
3. **Predictable outputs**: Consistent return format
4. **Error handling**: Graceful failure modes
5. **Documentation**: Clear descriptions for the agent

---

## Memory: The Agent's Mind

Agents need memory to maintain context and learn:

### Short-term Memory
- Current conversation
- Working context
- Immediate task state

### Long-term Memory
- Past interactions
- Learned preferences
- Domain knowledge

### Memory Strategies

- **RAG (Retrieval)**: Search through stored information
- **Summarization**: Condense long contexts
- **Key-value store**: Quick access to facts
- **Vector database**: Semantic similarity search

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple agent that can search the web and answer questions:

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
Create a simple research agent that:
1. Takes a question from the user
2. Searches the web for relevant information
3. Synthesizes the findings
4. Provides a comprehensive answer with sources

Use the Claude Agent SDK and include:
- Web search tool
- Note-taking for organizing information
- Source citation
```

### Expected Output

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

def research_agent(question: str) -> str:
    """Simple research agent that searches and synthesizes."""

    tools = [
        {
            "name": "web_search",
            "description": "Search the web for information",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["query"]
            }
        }
    ]

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Research this question thoroughly: {question}

            Use the web_search tool to find relevant information.
            Cite your sources in the final answer."""
        }
    ]

    # Agent loop
    while True:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
            max_tokens=4096,
            tools=tools,
            messages=messages
        )

        # Check for tool use
        if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
            # Execute tools and continue
            tool_results = execute_tools(response.content)
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
        else:
            # Agent completed
            return extract_text(response.content)
```

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Start simple**: Begin with single-task agents
2. **Add tools gradually**: One capability at a time
3. **Test extensively**: Agents can behave unexpectedly
4. **Monitor closely**: Watch for loops and errors
5. **Set boundaries**: Define what agents cannot do

### Common Pitfalls

- **Infinite loops**: Agent keeps trying same action
- **Tool misuse**: Wrong tool for the task
- **Context overflow**: Too much information
- **Hallucination**: Making up tool results
- **Cost explosion**: Uncontrolled API calls

### Safety Considerations

- Always require human approval for sensitive actions
- Implement rate limits and cost caps
- Log all agent actions for audit
- Use sandboxed environments for testing
- Define clear boundaries and permissions
