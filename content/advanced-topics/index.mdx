## Code Style
IMPORTANT: Use TypeScript strict mode
YOU MUST: Write tests before code
```

### Thinking Modes

Use extended thinking for complex tasks:

- `think` - Basic extended thinking
- `think hard` - Deeper analysis
- `think harder` - Very thorough
- `ultrathink` - Maximum effort

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Escape` - Interrupt Claude
- `Escape Escape` - Edit last prompt
- `/clear` - Reset context
- `#` - Update documentation
