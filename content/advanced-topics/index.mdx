## The Pro Workflow

This is the most important thing you'll learn. Following this pattern prevents 80% of common issues.

    A[🔍 Explore] --> B[📋 Plan]
    B --> C[💻 Code]
    C --> D[✅ Commit]
    D --> E{More work?}

    E -->|No| F[🚀 Ship]
`}
</Diagram>

### 1. Explore First

Before writing code, understand what exists:

```
Read src/auth/login.ts and src/lib/jwt.ts to understand
our current authentication flow.
```

Claude reads the code and summarizes. Now you both have context.

### 2. Plan with Thinking

Request a detailed plan before coding:

```
I need to add OAuth support. Think through how to implement this.
```

Use thinking modes for complex tasks:
- `think` — Basic extended thinking
- `think hard` — Deeper analysis
- `think harder` — Very thorough
- `ultrathink` — Maximum effort

### 3. Code Systematically

Work through the plan step by step:

```
Looks good! Start with step 1 - add OAuth provider configuration.
```

Don't skip steps. Don't rush ahead. Let Claude complete each piece.

### 4. Commit Cleanly

```
This looks great! Create a commit with an appropriate message.
```

Claude analyzes changes and writes a meaningful commit message.

## Quick Reference

### CLAUDE.md Files

Your secret weapon for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# My Project

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Code Style
IMPORTANT: Use TypeScript strict mode
YOU MUST: Write tests before implementation
NEVER: Use `any` type
```

**Where to place:**
- Project root — Project-specific guidelines
- Parent directory — Monorepo shared config
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Global preferences

### Thinking Modes

<InfoTable

  rows={[
    { mode: 'think', when: 'Complex tasks, planning' },
    { mode: 'think hard', when: 'Architecture decisions' },
    { mode: 'think harder', when: 'Debugging tricky issues' },
    { mode: 'ultrathink', when: 'Critical, high-stakes code' },
  ]}
/>

### Essential Shortcuts

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'shortcut', header: 'Shortcut' },
    { key: 'action', header: 'Action' },

    { shortcut: '#', action: 'Update documentation' },
    { shortcut: 'Tab', action: 'File/folder completion' },
  ]}
/>

### Custom Skills Quick Start

Create `.claude/commands/fix-issue.md`:

```markdown
# Fix GitHub Issue

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS from GitHub:
1. Read the issue description
2. Locate relevant code
3. Implement the fix
4. Create commit referencing issue
```

Use it: `/fix-issue 1234`
