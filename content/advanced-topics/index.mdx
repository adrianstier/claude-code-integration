## Quick Tips

### CLAUDE.md Files

Your secret weapon for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# My Project

## Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Code Style
IMPORTANT: Use TypeScript strict mode
YOU MUST: Write tests before code
```

### Thinking Modes

Use extended thinking for complex tasks:

- `think` - Basic extended thinking
- `think hard` - Deeper analysis
- `think harder` - Very thorough
- `ultrathink` - Maximum effort

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Escape` - Interrupt Claude
- `Escape Escape` - Edit last prompt
- `/clear` - Reset context
- `#` - Update documentation

### Custom Skills

Create reusable commands in `.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

Fix GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS:
1. Read the issue description
2. Locate relevant code
3. Implement the fix
4. Create commit referencing issue
```

Then use: `/fix-issue 1234`
