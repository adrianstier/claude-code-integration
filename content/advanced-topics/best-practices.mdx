## Part 1: Environment Customization

### CLAUDE.md — Your Secret Weapon

CLAUDE.md files are persistent instructions that Claude reads every time. Think of them as programming Claude for your specific project.

<Diagram title="CLAUDE.md Hierarchy" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart TB
    A[~/.claude/CLAUDE.md] --> B[Global Settings]
    C[../CLAUDE.md] --> D[Parent/Monorepo]
    E[./CLAUDE.md] --> F[Project Specific]

    B --> G[Claude Context]
    D --> G
    F --> G
`}
</Diagram>

#### What to Include

```markdown
# Project: My Awesome App

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server (port 3000)
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run lint` - ESLint with auto-fix

## Architecture
- `/src/components` - React components (TypeScript)
- `/src/lib` - Shared utilities
- `/src/app` - Next.js App Router pages

## Code Style
IMPORTANT: Always use TypeScript strict mode.
YOU MUST: Add JSDoc comments to exported functions.
NEVER: Use `any` type—use `unknown` instead.

## Testing
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Avoid mocks unless necessary
- Test edge cases: empty arrays, null, errors
```

#### Emphasis Keywords

Claude pays extra attention to these:

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'keyword', header: 'Keyword' },
    { key: 'effect', header: 'Effect' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { keyword: 'IMPORTANT:', effect: 'High priority instruction' },
    { keyword: 'YOU MUST:', effect: 'Required behavior' },
    { keyword: 'NEVER:', effect: 'Prohibited action' },
    { keyword: 'CRITICAL:', effect: 'Absolute requirement' },
  ]}
/>

#### Where to Place CLAUDE.md

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'location', header: 'Location' },
    { key: 'scope', header: 'Scope' },
    { key: 'usecase', header: 'Use Case' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { location: '~/.claude/CLAUDE.md', scope: 'Global', usecase: 'Personal preferences' },
    { location: '../CLAUDE.md', scope: 'Parent dir', usecase: 'Monorepo shared config' },
    { location: './CLAUDE.md', scope: 'Project root', usecase: 'Project-specific rules' },
    { location: './src/CLAUDE.md', scope: 'Subdirectory', usecase: 'Module-specific overrides' },
  ]}
/>

#### Generate Automatically

```bash
claude
/init
```

Claude analyzes your project and creates a tailored CLAUDE.md.

#### Update Quickly

Use the `#` shortcut:

```
# Add that we now use Prisma instead of raw SQL
```

Claude updates CLAUDE.md for you.

## Part 2: The Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

**The most important workflow. Master this first.**

<Diagram title="Detailed Workflow Steps" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart TB
    subgraph explore[1. Explore]
        E1[Read relevant files]
        E2[Understand architecture]
        E3[Ask clarifying questions]
    end

    subgraph plan[2. Plan]
        P1[Use 'think' mode]
        P2[Break into steps]
        P3[Identify risks]
    end

    subgraph code[3. Code]
        C1[Follow the plan]
        C2[One step at a time]
        C3[Test as you go]
    end

    subgraph commit[4. Commit]
        D1[Review changes]
        D2[Write clear message]
        D3[Push to remote]
    end

    explore --> plan --> code --> commit
`}
</Diagram>

#### Step 1: Explore

Ask Claude to READ first, not write:

```
Read src/auth/login.ts and src/lib/jwt.ts to understand
our current authentication flow.
```

```
Now read the tests in tests/auth/ to see what's already tested.
```

#### Step 2: Plan

Request a detailed plan:

```
I need to add OAuth support. Think through how to implement this.
```

Claude activates extended thinking and provides a structured plan with potential issues.

**Thinking modes:**
- `think` — Basic extended thinking
- `think hard` — Deeper analysis
- `think harder` — Very thorough
- `ultrathink` — Maximum thinking time

#### Step 3: Code

Work through the plan systematically:

```
Looks good! Start with step 1 - add OAuth provider configuration.
```

```
Done. Now step 2 - the callback handler.
```

Don't skip steps. Let each piece complete before moving on.

#### Step 4: Commit

```
This looks great! Create a commit with an appropriate message.
```

Claude analyzes your changes and writes a meaningful commit message.

---

### Workflow 2: Test-Driven Development

Claude excels with TDD because tests give clear targets.

<Diagram title="TDD Loop" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart LR
    A[Write Tests] --> B[Run Tests]
    B --> C{All Pass?}
    C -->|No| D[Implement]
    D --> B
    C -->|Yes| E[Commit]
`}
</Diagram>

#### Step 1: Write Tests First

```
I need a function that parses markdown frontmatter. Here are examples:

Input:
---
title: Hello
---
# Content

Output:
{ title: "Hello", content: "# Content" }

Write comprehensive test cases. Use real calls, not mocks.
```

#### Step 2: Verify Tests Fail

```
Run the tests to confirm they fail (no implementation yet).
```

#### Step 3: Commit Tests

```
Commit the tests.
```

#### Step 4: Implement Iteratively

```
Now implement the parser. Run tests after each change.
```

Claude implements, runs tests, fixes failures, repeats until green.

#### Step 5: Commit Implementation

```
All tests passing! Commit the implementation.
```

---

### Workflow 3: Visual Iteration

For UI work, iterate with screenshots.

<Diagram title="Visual Feedback Loop" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart LR
    A[Design Mock] --> B[Implement]
    B --> C[Screenshot]
    C --> D[Compare]
    D --> E{Match?}
    E -->|No| F[Adjust]
    F --> B
    E -->|Yes| G[Commit]
`}
</Diagram>

#### The Process

1. Share design mock (Figma screenshot, wireframe)
2. Claude implements
3. Take screenshot of result
4. Paste and ask for fixes
5. Repeat until perfect

```
[paste screenshot of Figma design]

Implement this dashboard component.
```

```
[paste screenshot of result]

Close but the spacing is off. Cards should have 24px gap, not 16px.
```

```
[paste updated screenshot]

Better! The blue should be #3B82F6 not #60A5FA.
```

**Pro tip:** On macOS, use `Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4` to screenshot directly to clipboard.

---

### Workflow 4: Codebase Q&A

Use Claude like a knowledgeable colleague.

```
How does our logging system work?
```

```
Where should I add a new API endpoint?
Show me the pattern I should follow.
```

```
When did we switch from Express to Next.js? Why?
```

Claude searches your codebase and git history to answer.

---

## Part 3: Tool Permissions & Extensions

### Configure Permissions

Three ways to manage what Claude can do:

**1. Interactive (during sessions):**
```
Claude: I need permission to run bash commands.
You: [Check "Always allow" → Allow]
```

**2. Via command:**
```
/permissions
```

**3. Manual configuration:**

Edit `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedTools": ["read", "write", "edit", "bash", "grep"],
  "autoApprove": {
    "bash": ["npm install", "npm run dev", "git status"]
  }
}
```

### Custom Slash Commands (Skills)

Create reusable prompts in `.claude/commands/`:

**`.claude/commands/fix-issue.md`**

```markdown
# Fix GitHub Issue

Pull issue $ARGUMENTS from GitHub and:
1. Read the issue description
2. Locate relevant code
3. Propose a fix
4. Implement with tests
5. Create PR referencing issue
```

**Usage:**
```
/fix-issue 1234
```

See [Claude Skills Guide](./skills) for comprehensive coverage.

## Part 4: Optimization Strategies

### Be Specific

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Vague (Bad)</Tab>
    <Tab>Specific (Good)</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel>

```
Add tests for foo.py
```

```
Make this faster
```

```
Fix the bug
```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>

```
Write test cases for foo.py covering the scenario where users are logged out.
Use real database calls, avoid mocks.
```

```
Optimize /api/users - it's taking 3 seconds.
Profile the database queries and add indexes if needed.
```

```
Fix the bug where clicking 'Save' twice creates duplicate entries.
The issue is in src/components/Form.tsx around line 45.
```

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Use Images

Claude can see images. Use this for:

- UI/UX work — Design mocks, screenshots
- Bug reports — Show what's broken
- Data visualization — Chart outputs
- Architecture — Diagrams, ERDs

### Reference Files Precisely

Use tab-completion:

```
Look at sr[TAB] → src/au[TAB] → src/auth/login.ts
```

Precise references = faster, more accurate responses.

### Clear Context Between Tasks

```
/clear
```

Use liberally when:
- Switching between unrelated tasks
- After completing major features
- Context feels muddled
- Starting something complex

### Course Correct Early

**Request plans before coding:**
```
Think through how to implement real-time notifications.
```

**Interrupt with Escape:**
Press `Escape` to stop Claude mid-response.

**Double-tap Escape:**
Edit your last prompt.

**Ask for undos:**
```
Undo those changes. I want to try a different approach.
```

## Part 5: Multi-Claude Workflows

### Parallel Verification

Use multiple Claude instances for better quality:

<Diagram title="Parallel Verification Pattern" type="flowchart">
{`flowchart TB
    A[Claude A: Implement] --> B[Code Ready]
    B --> C[Claude B: Review]
    C --> D{Issues?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Claude A: Fix]
    D -->|No| F[Commit]
    E --> C
`}
</Diagram>

**Terminal 1 (Claude A):**
```
Implement the user authentication system
```

**Terminal 2 (Claude B):**
```
Review the authentication code in src/auth/ for security issues
```

**Terminal 1 (Claude A):**
```
Fix these security issues: [paste Claude B's findings]
```

### Multiple Repository Checkouts

Work on multiple features simultaneously:

```bash
# Clone to multiple directories
git clone git@github.com:you/project.git project-feature-a
git clone git@github.com:you/project.git project-feature-b

# Or use git worktrees (lighter)
git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b feature-b
```

Run Claude in each directory with separate tasks.

### Headless Operations

For batch operations:

```bash
# Loop through files
for file in src/**/*.ts; do
  claude -p "Review $file for security issues" >> report.txt
done
```

## Part 6: Pro Tips

### Hidden Shortcuts

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'shortcut', header: 'Shortcut' },
    { key: 'action', header: 'Action' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { shortcut: 'Cmd/Ctrl + K', action: 'Clear screen' },
    { shortcut: 'Escape', action: 'Interrupt Claude' },
    { shortcut: 'Escape Escape', action: 'Edit last prompt' },
    { shortcut: '#', action: 'Update documentation' },
    { shortcut: '/', action: 'Slash commands menu' },
    { shortcut: 'Tab', action: 'File/folder completion' },
  ]}
/>

### Magic Phrases

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'phrase', header: 'Phrase' },
    { key: 'effect', header: 'Effect' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { phrase: 'think / think hard', effect: 'Extended thinking' },
    { phrase: 'IMPORTANT:', effect: 'Emphasis in instructions' },
    { phrase: '/init', effect: 'Generate CLAUDE.md' },
    { phrase: '/clear', effect: 'Reset context' },
  ]}
/>

### Debugging Claude

**Claude is stuck:**
```
/clear
Let's start over. [Rephrase clearly]
```

**Claude is hallucinating:**
```
Stop. Read the actual code first. Don't assume.
```

**Same mistake repeatedly:**
```
IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the `any` type.
YOU MUST use proper TypeScript types.
```

**Results not good enough:**
```
think harder

This solution won't scale. Consider:
1. What happens with 1M users?
2. Database indexing
3. Caching layer
4. Rate limiting
```

## Key Takeaways

### The Golden Rules

1. **Explore before coding** — Read files, understand context
2. **Plan before implementing** — Use `think` modes
3. **Be specific** — Vague prompts = poor results
4. **Iterate with feedback** — Visual/test feedback improves outcomes
5. **Clear context regularly** — Fresh start = focused results
6. **Use TDD** — Tests guide implementation
7. **Leverage tools** — Skills, MCP, custom commands
8. **Multiple Claudes for complex tasks** — Separate contexts catch issues

### Quick Reference

**Essential Commands:**
- `/init` — Generate CLAUDE.md
- `/clear` — Reset context
- `/permissions` — Configure tools
- `#` — Update documentation

**Workflows:**
1. Explore → Plan → Code → Commit
2. TDD: Tests → Red → Green → Commit
3. Visual: Mock → Implement → Screenshot → Iterate
