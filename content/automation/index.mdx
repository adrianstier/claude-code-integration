# Automation Track

Stop doing repetitive tasks manually. Let Claude help you automate them!

<Callout type="tip" title="Why Automate?">
Every minute spent automating a daily 5-minute task saves you 30+ hours per year. Start with tasks you do repeatedly, and watch your productivity compound.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

- Build Python scripts for file automation
- Create scheduled tasks and cron jobs
- Set up VS Code task automation
- Generate reports automatically
- Process data pipelines

## What You'll Automate

| Automation Type | Time Saved | Difficulty |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| File organization | 2-5 hrs/week | Beginner |
| Report generation | 3-8 hrs/week | Intermediate |
| Data pipelines | 5-20 hrs/week | Advanced |
| Email processing | 1-3 hrs/week | Intermediate |
| Scheduled backups | Peace of mind | Beginner |

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Start Here](/start-here) track
- Basic Python or Bash knowledge (or let Claude teach you!)
- Terminal/command line familiarity

## Time Required

3-4 hours to complete core concepts

---

## Project 1: File Organizer

**Problem:** Downloads folder is a mess with hundreds of files.

**Solution:** Build a smart file organizer that automatically sorts files.

### Ask Claude to Build It

```
Write a Python script to organize my Downloads folder:
- Move images (.jpg, .png, .gif) to Pictures/
- Move PDFs to Documents/PDFs/
- Move videos (.mp4, .mov) to Videos/
- Move code files to Projects/
- Create dated subfolders (2025-01/)
- Add a log file of what was moved
- Include a --dry-run mode for testing

Make it safe with error handling.
```

### Expected Features

Claude will create a script with:
- File type detection
- Safe moves (no overwrites)
- Dry-run preview mode
- Detailed logging
- Configurable rules

### Run It

```bash
# Preview what will happen
python organize.py --dry-run

# Actually organize files
python organize.py

# Check the log
cat organize.log
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Safety First">
Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes. Never run file operations on important folders without testing.
</Callout>

## Project 2: Weekly Report Generator

**Problem:** You generate the same report every week manually.

**Solution:** Automate the entire process from data to PDF.

### Ask Claude to Build It

```
Automate my weekly sales report:
1. Read data from sales.csv
2. Calculate KPIs (total revenue, growth, top products)
3. Generate charts with matplotlib
4. Create a professional PDF report
5. Save with date in filename

Use Python with pandas and matplotlib.
Include error handling for missing data.
```

### Sample Output Structure

```
reports/
   weekly_report_2025-01-15.pdf
   charts/
      revenue_trend.png
      top_products.png
```

### Schedule It (Mac)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run every Monday at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && python report_generator.py
```

### Schedule It (Windows)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger: Weekly, Monday, 9:00 AM
4. Set action: Start program
5. Program: `python`
6. Arguments: `C:\path\to\report_generator.py`

---

## Project 3: Batch File Renaming

**Problem:** 100+ files need systematic renaming for organization.

**Solution:** Build a smart renamer with preview and undo.

### Ask Claude to Build It

```
Create a batch file renamer that:
- Renames IMG_1234.jpg to 2025-01-15_photo_001.jpg
- Uses file creation date for the date prefix
- Adds sequential numbering
- Has preview mode (shows old -> new)
- Creates an undo script
- Handles duplicates safely

Include a config file for customization.
```

### Safe Workflow

```bash
# 1. Preview changes
python renamer.py --preview

# 2. Check the preview output
# 3. Run if it looks correct
python renamer.py

# 4. If something went wrong
python undo_rename.py
```

---

## Project 4: Data Pipeline

**Problem:** Manual data processing is error-prone and slow.

**Solution:** Build an automated ETL pipeline.

### Ask Claude to Build It

```
Create a data pipeline that:
1. Fetches data from an API endpoint
2. Cleans and validates the data
3. Transforms into the required format
4. Loads into a SQLite database
5. Generates a summary report
6. Sends email notification on completion/error

Use Python with requests and sqlite3.
Add retry logic for API failures.
Log all steps with timestamps.
```

### Pipeline Architecture

```
[API Source] --> [Extract] --> [Transform] --> [Load] --> [Report]
                    |              |              |
                    v              v              v
                [Logging]     [Validation]   [Database]
```

## VS Code Task Automation

Automate common workflows directly in VS Code.

### Ask Claude to Create Tasks

```
Create VS Code tasks for my Python project:
1. Run current file (F5)
2. Run all tests (Ctrl+Shift+T)
3. Format with black (Ctrl+Shift+F)
4. Lint with flake8 (Ctrl+Shift+L)
5. Deploy to server (Ctrl+Shift+D)

Create .vscode/tasks.json with keyboard shortcuts.
```

### Example tasks.json

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Run Python File",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "python ${file}",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "new"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Run Tests",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "pytest tests/ -v",
      "group": "test"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Automation Best Practices

### 1. Test First

<Callout type="warning" title="Golden Rule">
Never run automation on production data without testing on copies first.
</Callout>

- Always add `--dry-run` or preview mode
- Test on sample data before full runs
- Keep backups of original files

### 2. Log Everything

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    filename='automation.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

logging.info('Starting file organization...')
```

### 3. Use Version Control

```bash
# Initialize git for your automation scripts
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add file organizer script"
```

### 4. Document Your Scripts

Ask Claude:
```
Add comprehensive docstrings and a README to my script.
Include usage examples and configuration options.
```

### 5. Handle Errors Gracefully

```python
try:
    process_file(filepath)
except FileNotFoundError:
    logging.error(f"File not found: {filepath}")
except PermissionError:
    logging.error(f"Permission denied: {filepath}")
```

## Quick Reference: Scheduling

### Mac/Linux (cron)

| Schedule | Cron Expression |
|----------|----------------|
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` |
| Daily at 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` |
| Weekly (Monday 9 AM) | `0 9 * * 1` |
| Monthly (1st at 9 AM) | `0 9 1 * *` |

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# List current jobs
crontab -l
```

### Windows (Task Scheduler)

1. Search "Task Scheduler" in Start menu
2. Action > Create Basic Task
3. Follow the wizard for triggers and actions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Not Running on Schedule

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Check if cron is running
sudo service cron status

# Check cron logs
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```

**Windows:**
- Check Task Scheduler History tab
- Verify "Run whether user is logged on or not"

### Permission Errors

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x script.py

# Check file ownership
ls -la script.py
```

### Path Issues in Scheduled Tasks

Always use absolute paths in scheduled scripts:
```python
import os
SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
DATA_PATH = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, 'data', 'input.csv')
```
