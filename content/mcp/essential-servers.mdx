# Essential MCP Servers

MCP servers are plugins that give Claude Code access to external tools, data sources, and services. This guide covers the 10 most essential servers with exact installation commands and real-world examples.

<Callout type="info" title="How to Read This Guide">
Every server includes two setup methods: the `claude mcp add` CLI command (fastest) and the equivalent JSON config (for `.mcp.json`). Pick whichever you prefer — they produce the same result.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Best For">
Looking up current documentation, finding error solutions, checking latest library versions, and researching changed APIs.
</Callout>

### Setup

  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

Search for the current fix.
```

---

## 5. Sentry (Error Tracking)

**Connect Claude to your Sentry account to read error reports and correlate bugs with code changes.**

<Callout type="tip" title="Best For">
Debugging production errors, triaging by frequency and impact, and connecting stack traces to code changes.
</Callout>

### Setup

```bash
# Remote MCP with OAuth — nothing to install
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="OAuth Authentication">
Sentry uses OAuth — you will be prompted to log in via your browser the first time Claude connects. No API key needed.
</Callout>

### Real-World Prompts

```
What are the top 5 unresolved errors from the last 24 hours? Rank by frequency.
```

```
Show the full stack trace for issue PROJ-1234. What's the likely root cause?
```

Did any new errors start after yesterday's deploy?
```

---

## 6. Filesystem

**Secure local file operations with directory-level access controls.**

<Callout type="info" title="When Do You Need This?">
Claude Code already has built-in file access within your project. The Filesystem MCP is for accessing files **outside** your project — config files in `~/`, data in `~/Downloads`, etc.
</Callout>

### Setup

```bash
claude mcp add filesystem -- \
  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem \
  /Users/you/Documents \
  /Users/you/Downloads
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Limit Directory Access">
Only grant access to directories Claude actually needs. Never add `/` or your entire home directory.
</Callout>

### Real-World Prompts

```
List all CSV files in my Downloads folder from the last week.
```

```
Find all package.json files across ~/Documents and list which use React 18 vs 19.
```

---

## 7. Sequential Thinking

**Structured reasoning for complex problems — Claude thinks step-by-step with the ability to revise and branch.**

<Callout type="tip" title="Best For">
Complex architectural decisions, multi-step debugging, system design, and migration planning.
</Callout>

### Setup

```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- \
  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

<Callout type="info" title="You Must Ask For It">
Claude won't automatically use sequential thinking. Say "use sequential thinking" or "think through this step by step using the sequential thinking tool."
</Callout>

### Real-World Prompts

```
Use sequential thinking to analyze whether we should migrate
from Pages Router to App Router. Consider: codebase size,
team familiarity, feature requirements, and migration risk.
```

```
Use sequential thinking to debug why authentication state
isn't persisting across page refreshes.
```

---

## 8. Memory & Context7

Two complementary servers for long-term memory and current documentation.

### Memory (Knowledge Graph)

**Persistent memory that lets Claude remember information across sessions.**

```bash
claude mcp add memory -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

**Prompts:**

```
Remember that our project uses Supabase RLS with soft deletes,
and we always use supabase.auth.getUser() in server components.
```

```
What do you remember about our project's architecture?
```

### Context7 (Live Documentation)

**Fetches up-to-date, version-specific documentation from official sources.**

```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
```

<Callout type="info" title="Usage Trigger">
Append **"use context7"** to any prompt and Claude will fetch current docs before generating code.
</Callout>

**Prompts:**

```
How do I set up server-side auth with Supabase in Next.js 15? use context7
```

```
Show me the current API for React Query's useMutation with TypeScript. use context7
```

---

## 9. Fetch

**Fetch any URL and convert it to markdown — read documentation, API responses, and web pages.**

```bash
claude mcp add fetch -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch
```

### Real-World Prompts

```
Fetch https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs
and summarize the key setup steps.
```

```
Fetch our API at https://api.example.com/v1/schema and generate
TypeScript types from the JSON response.
```

---

## 10. Slack

**Read and send Slack messages, search workspace history.**

```bash
claude mcp add --env SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN \
  --env SLACK_TEAM_ID=T0123456789 \
  slack -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-slack
```

<Callout type="info" title="Creating a Slack Bot Token">
1. Create an app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Add scopes: `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `users:read`
3. Install to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-`)
</Callout>

### Real-World Prompts

```
Search #engineering for discussions about the database migration
from the last week. Summarize key decisions.
```

```
Draft a message for #team-updates summarizing what I shipped
this week based on my recent git commits. Show me the draft first.
```

---

## Managing Your Servers

```bash
claude mcp list              # List all configured servers
claude mcp get github        # Details for a specific server
claude mcp remove github     # Remove a server
claude mcp add -s user fetch -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch  # User scope (all projects)
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Scoping Strategy">
Use `-s user` for servers you want everywhere (Brave Search, Memory, Fetch). Use the default local scope for project-specific servers (databases, Sentry).
</Callout>

---

## Recommended Starter Stack

<InfoTable
  columns={[
    { key: 'order', header: '#' },
    { key: 'server', header: 'Server' },
    { key: 'why', header: 'Why Start Here' },
  ]}
  rows={[
    { order: '1', server: 'Context7', why: 'Eliminates outdated code suggestions immediately' },
    { order: '2', server: 'Playwright', why: 'Visual verification of UI changes' },
    { order: '3', server: 'GitHub', why: 'Automates PR and issue workflow end-to-end' },
  ]}
/>

Then add Brave Search and Memory as your second round — and project-specific servers (Postgres, Sentry, Slack) as your workflow demands them.

<Callout type="success" title="Start Small, Then Expand">
Pick one MCP server that solves your biggest pain point. Use it for a week until it feels natural. Then add another. Within a month, you'll have Claude querying your database, verifying your UI, and managing your GitHub workflow — all from a single terminal.
